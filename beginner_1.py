# OPERATIONS are are direct actions on data, like getting or modifying parts of it. It doesnâ€™t require a function or method call and works directly with data
# String Operation (indexing) allows you to access an individual character in a string using its respective position. Indexing in Python starts from 0

# String Operation (slicing) enables one to get a particular segment of a string, by defining a start index, stop index, and an optional step value
